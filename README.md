# Problem Motivation

In the traditional attendance marking system,there are many drawbacks.Some of the major drawbacks are as follows.
* Too much paperwork
* risk of human error
* keyboard and printing error
* lot of calculations

In this project,our goal is to develop a ***modern attendance marking system*** that is suitable for today's world.In parallel with the attendance marking system,a ***fully-fledged time table managing*** and ***lecture reminding system*** is developed.

# How things work...

On the registration day of the students,fingerprints and student details are taken and added to the database using the website.A RFID token is registered for a student and given to them.Student can do the registration via the website or mobile app.Before a particular class starts,corresponding student details and fingerprint details are loaded into the sd card and fingerprint device with the help of nodemcu & backend server for student identification purposes.when a particular student put their attendance using fingerprint device and RFID sensor student details are displayed in the LCD display.At the same time,new attendance data is sent to the backend.All timetable data is added to the database and lecture reminding is automatically done by the server.Student and teachers are able to analyze and visualize attendance data via the website or mobile app.
